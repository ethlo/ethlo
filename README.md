Hello!

I'm Morten Haraldsen, an experienced software architect and developer with a passion for algorithms, data structures, databases, and performance optimization. I specialize in enhancing system performance through code refinement, database tuning, and cache optimization.

### Here are some of my notable projects:

* [ITU](https://github.com/ethlo/itu) - Date-Time Parser and Formatter: An extremely fast parser and formatter for standardized dates and date-times, supporting RFC-3339 (ISO-8601 profile) and more.
* [Spring Transaction-Aware Cache Decorator](https://github.com/ethlo/spring-tx-cache-decorator): A transaction-aware cache decorator that holds cache values transiently until commit to avoid polluting the cache with invalid values in case of a rollback.
* [Chronograph](https://github.com/ethlo/chronograph): A highly configurable, easy-to-use stopwatch allowing measurement of accumulated run-time, with support for numerous statistics.
* [Eclipselink Maven Plugin](https://github.com/ethlo/eclipselink-maven-plugin): A Maven plugin for Eclipselink JPA, supporting static weaving, canonical model generation, and DDL generation.
* [JSON Schema to XSD Converter](https://github.com/ethlo/json2xsd): A highly configurable converter from JSON Schema to XML Schema (XSD).

I hope you find these libraries useful. If you have any questions or encounter any problems, please feel free to open an issue!
